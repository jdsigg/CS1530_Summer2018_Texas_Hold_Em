Nice stack, bitch
I've been playing poker before you were born
How do you type with gloves on your hands?
Ye mom is ye dad in a wig
You could mess up a cup of coffee
I will take your money now
I eat poker chips like you for breakfast
You are a big cup of salasa
I pity the fool
Bro, you weigh 200 stones
You are premature optimization
Poker? I hardly even know her!
You playing this in class? Pay attention!
Bill Laboon loves Python
You play poker like Justin plays Fortnite

It's my money and I want it now!
Save it for Queen Doppelpopolous.
Ni!
You must find.... A SHRUBBERY!
