Class Naming:
Capital letter for each word's start in class. Letters after the first letter in any abbreviations will be lowercase (i.e. SCUBA would be named Scuba)

Method Naming:

Variable Naming:
First letter of first word in variable name is lowercase. All subsequent words are uppercase. (i.e. texasHoldEm)

Commenting:
In line comments are acceptable. Block comments above methods to describe their purpose. Block comments
will be in line with the blocks, not indented. 

Indents:
Tabs on each indent 

Brackets:
Opening bracket below method declaration

Lines:
Lines should not be over 140 lines

Whitespace:
Use appropriate whitespace as needed

Methods:
Methods used more than twice shall be combined and placed into a class reachable to classes that need its access
Common/re-used/repeated chunks of code shall be combined as to avoid having reused
